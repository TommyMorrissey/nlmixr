## The broom and broom.mixed packages

`broom` and `broom.mixed` are packages that attempt to put standard
model outputs into data frames.  nlmixr supports the `tidy` and
`glance` methods but does not support `augment` at this time.

Using a model with a covariance term, the [Phenobarbital
model](addingCovariances.html), we can explore the different types of
output that is used in the tidy functions.

To explore this, first we run the model:

```{r}
library(nlmixr)
## To allow nlmixr to reload runs without large run times
## To run the actual models on your system, take the save options off.
options(nlmixr.save=TRUE,
        nlmixr.save.dir=system.file(package="nlmixr"));

pheno <- function() {
  ini({
    tcl <- log(0.008) # typical value of clearance
    tv <-  log(0.6)   # typical value of volume
    ## var(eta.cl)
    eta.cl + eta.v ~ c(1, 
                       0.01, 1) ## cov(eta.cl, eta.v), var(eta.v)
                      # interindividual variability on clearance and volume
    add.err <- 0.1    # residual variability
  })
  model({
    cl <- exp(tcl + eta.cl) # individual value of clearance
    v <- exp(tv + eta.v)    # individual value of volume
    ke <- cl / v            # elimination rate constant
    d/dt(A1) = - ke * A1    # model differential equation
    cp = A1 / v             # concentration in plasma
    cp ~ add(add.err)       # define error model
  })
}

fit <- nlmixr(pheno, pheno_sd, "saem")
```
# Glancing at the goodness of fit metrics

Often in fitting data, you would want to `glance` at the fit to see
how well it fits.  In `broom`, `glance` will give a summary of the fit
metrics of goodness of fit:

```{r}
glance(fit)
```

Note in nlmixr it is possible to have more than one fit metric (based
on different quadratures, FOCEi approximation etc).  However, the
`glance` only returns the fit metrics that are current.

If you add conditional weighted residuals to the fit the objective
function is changed to the `FOCEi` metric:

```{r}
fit <- fit %>% addCwres()
```

Now the glance gives the `FOCEi` values.

```{r}
glance(fit)
```

Of course you can always change the type of objective function that
nlmixr uses:

```{r}
setOfv(fit,"gauss3_1.6") # Setting objective function to gauss3_1.6
```

By setting it back to the SAEM default objective function of
`gauss3_1.6`, the `glance(fit)` has the same values again:

```{r}
glance(fit)
```

For convenience, you can do this while you `glance` at the objects:

```{r}
glance(fit, type="FOCEi")
```

# Tidying the model parameters
## Tidying of overall fit parameters

You can also tidy the model estimates into a data frame with broom for
processing.  This can be useful when integrating into 3rd parting
modeling packages.  With a consistent parameter format, tasks for
multiple types of models can be automated and applied. 

The default function for this is `tidy`, which when applied to the
`fit` object provides the overall parameter information in a tidy
dataset:

```{r}
tidy(fit)
```

nlmixr converts the log-transformed estimates to the normal scale for
these tidy summaries, just like what was done for the `fit$parFixedDf`
data frame.  Unlike that data-frame, the standard errors are also
transformed by an approximation to the normal scale. 

By default, this only applies to parameters that nlmixr has determined
are on a log-scale (those that are not are not included in the
transformation).  This behavior can be turned on or off with the
`exponentiate` argument.

```{r}
tidy(fit, exponentiate=FALSE) ## No transformation applied
```

```{r}
tidy(fit, exponentiate=TRUE) ## No transformation applied on every parameter
```

Note that the default is `exponentiate=NA` which is adaptive
exponentiation.

Also note, at the time of this writing the default separator between
variables is `.`, which doesn't work well with this model giving
`cor__eta.v.eta.cl`.  You can easily change this by:

```{r}
options(broom.mixed.sep2="..")
tidy(fit)
```

This gives an easier way to parse value: `cor__eta.v..eta.cl`

## Adding a confidence interval to the parameters

The default R method `confint` works with nlmixr fit objects:

```{r}
confint(fit)
```

This transforms the variables as described above.  You can still use
the `exponentiate` parameter to control the display of the confidence
interval:

```{r}
confint(fit, exponentiate=FALSE)
```

However, broom has also implemented it own way to make these data a
tidy dataset.  The easiest way to get these values in a nlmixr dataset
is to use:

```{r}
tidy(fit, conf.level=0.9)
```
The confidence interval is on the scale specified by `exponentiate`, by default the adaptive scale. 

# Extracting other model information with `tidy`
The type of information that is extracted can be controlled by the `effects` argument.
## Extracting only fixed effect parameters

The fixed effect parameters can be extracted by `effects="fixed"`

```{r}
tidy(fit, effects="fixed")
```
## Extracting only random parameters

The random standard deviations can be extracted by
`effects="ran_pars"`:

```{r}
tidy(fit, effects="ran_pars")
```
## Extracting random values (also called ETAs)

The random values, or in NONMEM the ETAs, can be extracted by
`effects="ran_vals"` or `effects="random"`

```{r}
tidy(fit, effects="ran_vals")
```

This duplicate method of running `effects` is because the `broom`
package supports `effects="random"` while the `broom.mixed` package
supports `effects="ran_vals"`.

## Extracting random coefficients

Random coefficients are the population fixed effect parameter + the
random effect parameter, possibly transformed to the correct scale.

In this case we can extract this information from a nlmixr fit object by:

```{r}
tidy(fit, effects="ran_coef")
```
This can also be changed by the `exponentiate` argument

```{r}
tidy(fit, effects="ran_coef", exponentiate=FALSE)
```
# An example of using a tidy model estimates for other packages

As explained above, this standard format makes it easier for tidyverse
packages to interact with model information.  An example of this is
piping the tidy information to dplyr to filter the effects and then to
the `dotwhisker` package to plot the model parameter confidence
intervals.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dotwhisker)
library(dplyr)
fit %>%
    tidy() %>%
    filter(effect=="fixed") %>%
    dwplot()
```

Happy tidying!
